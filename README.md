# Ad2Cat_StoneLab_DH2024

## About

Ad2Cat is a state of the art piece of AI software that is meant to be a part of every day life in the near future where hyper-reality is the norm. It's intended to run on AR/VR glasses and provide the user with the means to substitute ads seen in the real world with cat pics, memes, etc. .

Ad2Cat consists of mainly 2 parts:
1) ad detection - it detects ads with a slightly tweaked yolo model
2) image substitution - it picks an appropriate image to place over the ad and displays it

## Code

For training of the model we were using google colab, because of its free resources and thus that code is in a jupyter notebook, titled "TrainingNotebook.ipynb".

The whole code used to run the trained model on the laptop is in Ad2Cat.py.
